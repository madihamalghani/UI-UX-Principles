# Prototype:

### **What is a Prototype?**

A **prototype** is a **rough sample** or **early model** of your design that shows **how your app or website will work**.

Think of it like:

- A **demo version**
- A **practice version**
- A **clickable model**
- A **testing version**

It is **not the final product**.

It is made just to **check the flow**, **test ideas**, and **see if users understand it**.

### **Example (Very Simple):**

You want to make a **restaurant app**.

Before making the full app, you create a **prototype** where users can:

- Click on menu items
- Try booking a table
- Move between screens

Even if it’s not fully functional, it helps you test:

- Does the screen make sense?
- Do users know where to click?
- Is anything confusing?

### Types of Prototypes:

1. **Low-fidelity prototype**
    - Simple boxes and text
    - Black & white
    - Rough layout
2. **High-fidelity prototype**
    - Looks like the real app
    - Colors, icons, images
    - Clickable interactions

### Why do we make a prototype?

- To **test your idea early**
- To **find mistakes before development**
- To **show it to clients or teachers**
- To **save time and money**

This is a prototype designed before developing a web page. 

**What it can do?**

- Click on reserve a table and it will swap the layout
- Check & uncheck radio
- Clearly defines color and structure for a web page
