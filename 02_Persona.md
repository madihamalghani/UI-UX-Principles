# What is a Persona in Figma?

A **persona** in Figma is a **fake character** you create to represent your **target user**.

It helps you design better because you always keep this “user” in mind.

A persona includes:

- **Name**
- **Age**
- **Job**
- **Goals**
- **Frustrations (pain points)**
- **Short intro line (about the character)**
- **Photo (optional)**

You make it like a **small profile card** so it is easy to read.

# Why do we make a Persona?

Because it helps you understand:

- Who you are designing for
- What they want
- What problems they face
- How your design can solve their problems

It keeps your design **focused on real user needs**.

## **Recommended Persona Frame Size**

Use a **desktop-sized frame** so you have enough space:

### **Suggested size:**

**1440 × 1024 px**

(or any size close to this)

This size is perfect because:

- It fits all your persona info neatly
- It keeps everything on one screen
- It looks professional when shared
- It gives enough room for photo + text sections
