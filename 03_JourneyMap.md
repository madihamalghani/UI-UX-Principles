# Journey Map:

## **What is a Journey Map?**

A **Journey Map** is a simple diagram that shows:

➡️ **How a user moves step-by-step** when using your product, website, or service.

➡️ **What the user feels, thinks, and does** at each step.

➡️ **Where they face problems** and **where things work well**.

## **Why do we make a Journey Map?**

Because it helps you understand:

- What the user likes
- What confuses the user
- Where you can improve your design
- How to make the experience smoother

---

## **Very Simple Example**

Imagine a user wants to **book a table** on a restaurant website.

A Journey Map would show:

1. **User opens the website**
    - Feeling: curious
    - Problem: page loads slowly
2. **User searches for “Reserve a Table”**
    - Feeling: confused
    - Problem: button is hard to find
3. **User selects date & time**
    - Feeling: happy
    - Problem: none
4. **User submits the form**
    - Feeling: satisfied
    - Problem: confirmation email not received

This is a journey map — simple steps, feelings, actions, and pain points.

## **What does a Journey Map usually contain?**

- **User Persona** (Who is the user)
- **Stages** (Steps the user takes)
- **User Actions**
- **User Thoughts**
- **User Feelings**
- **Pain Points**
- **Opportunities for Improvement**
